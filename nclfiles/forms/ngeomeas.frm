NCL Measurement
===============
This form allows you to measure the distance between geometric entities and/or
motion and to measure the radius of curvature of any entity.

Measurement:
------------
To measure the closest distance between two entities, select "Closest Distance",
press the Select button, and then pick any two geometric entities or motion.
The closest distance can be found between two geometric enties, two movements,
or a combination of the two.  The minimum distance between the two entities and
the angle between the normal/tangent vectors will be displayed in the Status
window.  Picking a curve will use the tangent vector at the location and picking
a surface will use the normal vector.

Selecting "Picked Distance" will measure the distance between at the locations
that the entities were picked.  The distance between the two locations and the
angle between the normal/tangent vectors at these locations will be displayed in
the Status window.

For distance measurements, the tangent vector of a curve at the selected
location or the normal vector of a surface will be used.  The distance between
the two locations will be displayed, unless one of the entities is a vector. If
one of the selections is a point, then only the distance will be displayed.

To measure the radius of curvature of an entity, select "Radius", press the
Select button, and then pick any geometric entity or motion.  The radius of
curvature of the entity and the arc length used in the calculation will be
displayed in the Status window.  For a surface, the values in both the U and
V direction will be displayed.

Select
------
The Select button enters picking mode and allows you to select the geometric
entity(s) or motion to measure.  The results will be displayed in the Status
window after the selections are made and a visual representation of the geometry
used to make the measurements will be displayed in the graphics window.  Note
that the default picking type will be geometric entities and so to pick motion
the Alt-Act button must be pressed.  To switch back to geometric entity picking,
press the Alt-Act button again.

Single Selection:
-----------------
Normally, the NCL Measurement form will remain displayed after pressing the
Select button and the selection process will be modal, which means after a
selection is made, the results will be displayed and you will remain in
selection mode until you hit either Done or Reject.

If the Single Selection box is checked, then the form will go away when
selection mode is entered and will be redisplayed after the selection is made.
Selection mode will automatically be ended after a valid selection is made.

Units:
------
Normally the measurements output to the Status window will be in the same units
as the model, but you can change the measurements to be output explicitly in
Inches or Millimeters by selecting the desired output units in this field.

Tolerances
----------
The Tolerances button brings up a second form that allows you to change various
tolerances/settings used for measurements.

Colors
------
The Colors button brings up a second form that allows you to change various
color settings used for displaying the measurement input and results.

Single Move
-----------
If the Single Move box is checked, then single motion segments will be available
for selection when picking mode is entered.  If the Single Move box is left
unchecked, then the entire movement generated by a motion command will be
available for selection when picking mode is entered.

Status
------
Displays the results of the measurement.
