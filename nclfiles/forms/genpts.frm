===========
GENPTS Form
===========
This form sets the parameters for the GENPTS/POINT or the GENPTS/PNTVEC 
commands, which notify NCL to start saving the points and vectors generated by
NCL motion. 

Geometry Type:
--------------
The geometry type (Points or Point-Vectors) that is to be generated by driving
NCL motion. 

Vector Type:
------------
This field is only active when the geometry type is set to Point-Vectors.

Forward - The geometry array will contain point-vectors where the vector 
components are the forward directions associated with the generated points.

Tool axis - The geometry array will contain point-vectors where the vector 
components are the tool axis vectors associated with the generated points.

Point Creation:
---------------
This field determines the type of points and vectors to create when driving
the NCL motion.

Tool End - Creates geometry using the tool end point of the motion.  The tool
axis vectors will be stored in the tool axis vector array.

Arc End - This option is the same as Tool End, except when circular motion is
encountered only the end point of the circle will be output.  The intermediate
points of the circular arc will not be output to the geometry array.

Part Surface - Creates geometry using the part surface contact point of the
motion.  The part surface normals will be stored in the tool axis vector array.
Any motion that does not contain the part surface contact point will be ignored
and not stored in the geometry array, for example, GOTO, GODLTA, etc.

Drive Surface - Creates geometry using the drive surface contact point of the
motion.  The drive surface normals will be stored in the tool axis vector array.
Any motion that does not contain the drive surface contact point will be ignored
and not stored in the geometry array, for example, GOTO, GODLTA, etc.

Number of Entities Scalar:
--------------------------
This scalar will contain the number of geometry entities created during GENPTS
motion.

Geometry Label:
---------------
The point/point-vector entities are stored in the elements of this 
reserved array.

Forward Vector:
---------------
This field is only active when the geometry type is set to Points or the vector
type is set to Tool axis and contains the array label that will receive the 
forward direction vectors during GENPTS motion.

Tool axis Vector: 
-----------------
This Field is only active when the geometry type is set to Points or the vector
type is set to Forward and contains the array label that will receive the tool
axis vectors during GENPTS motion.

Apply Clfile Modifications
--------------------------
GENPTS will typically generate points immediately following a successful
motion command.  These points will not contain any modifications made by the
clfile manipulation routines, such as ARCSLP/FILLET and REVERS/ON.

Check this box if you would like the clfile modifications applied to the defined
points.  In this case, the points will not actually be generated until the next
GENPTS command is issued.
