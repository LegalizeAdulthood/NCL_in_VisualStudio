Motion Data
===========
This form displays the attributes and generating source lines for the selected
motion.

Highlight
---------
In verify mode, either the Entire Motion that was generated by a single command
can be highlighted when the cursor is placed over any section of that motion,
or only a Single Move within the displayed motion can be highlighted.  Either
method will still display the attributes for the move and the source that
generated the entire motion.

Select
------
Selects a new motion segment to display the attributes for.

Source
------
Displays the source code that generated the displayed motion.

Call Stack
----------
Displays the active call/loop stack when the displayed motion was generated.
The call/loop stack consists of the actual command that generated the motion
and any Macro calls or DO loops that were active at the time of the motion's
creation.

Macro calls will display simply as CALL/macro and DO loops will be displayed
as DO/lable,index=n, where 'index' is the name of the controlling DO loop
variable and 'n' is its value at the time that the motion was generated.

Selecting a line from the Call Stack list will display the associated source
lines in the Source list.

Reset line number after edit
----------------------------
Checking this box causes NCL to reset the current source line number to the
line that was active prior to displaying the Entity Data form.  If this box is
not checked, then the current source line will be the line that was active when
Command Mode was exited after pressing the Edit button.

Edit
----
Pressing the Edit button when there is source code displayed will enter
Command Mode at the line that is active in the Source list.

Motion Data
-----------
Displays the from and to position of the selected motion along with its cutting
attributes.
