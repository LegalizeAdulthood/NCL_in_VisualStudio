=======================
Verify Preview Motion
=======================
This form is used to perform material removal verification of the motion
generated by Preview button using NCLIPV.  You can process the entire motion
or step back and forth through it one move at a time.  The NCLIPV motion stack
must be enabled in order to step back through the motion.  You can also use the
defined keyboard keys to step through the motion.

Stock Type:
-----------
A stock must be defined before you are able to simulate the material removal of
the Preview motion.  You can either use an existing (predefined) stock or 
create a temporary stock to use to verify the Preview motion.  The following
options are available to you.

When a temporary stock is created and there is an existing stock, then the
existing stock will be saved and only the temporary stock will be used in the
Preview simulation.

  Existing
  --------
  This option can only be selected when a stock has been previously defined.
  The Preview motion will be simulated against the existing stock, which will
  include any previous cuts already simulated.

  Motion Box
  ----------
  Generates a bounding box temporary stock around the Preview motion.

  Surface Contour
  ---------------
  Generates a temporary contour stock around the surfaces used in the Preview
  motion.  You will not be able to add any surfaces to create this stock and
  if no surfaces are used in the Preview motion, then a this stock type cannot
  be generated.

  Prim File
  ---------
  Generates the temporary stock from an external Stock Primitive File.

  STL File
  --------
  Generates the temporary stock from an external STL file.

Define Stock
------------
Press this button to bring up the interface to create the type of stock
specified in the Stock Type field.  This button is not active when an existing
stock is being used.

Keep Stock
----------
Checking this box will keep the cut stock after exiting this form so that it
will be used in the next NCLIPV simulation session.  When an existing stock
is used, then the stock cuts generated during this Preview simulation will
become permanent.  When a temporary stock is used, then the cut temporary stock
will be saved and become a permanent stock available in the next NCLIPV
simulation session.  You cannot save temporary stocks when there is already an
existing stock and this field will be disabled in this case.

View
----
Pressing the view button enables Dynamic Viewing within the NCLIPV window.

<<
--
Resets the Verify Preview Motion session to its initial state, with all cuts
made during the Preview simulation removed.

<
_
Steps the preview simulation back one move.  This button is only active when
the NCLIPV Undo Stack is enabled.

Speed
-----
Defines the speed at which the Preview simulation will be animated when the play
button '-->' is pressed.  Setting the speed to 100% causes the simulation to be
performed at full speed.  You can move the slider to slow down simulation and
to speed it up.

>
_
Steps the Preview simulation forward one move.

>>
--
Fast forwards (performs all cuts of) the Preview simulation to the end of the
simulation.  All cuts will be simulated and the NCLIPV window will not be
updated until all cuts are performed.

-->
---
Animates the Preview simulation from the current position to the end of the
generated motion.

Steps:
------
Defines the number of tool movements to simulate prior to updating the NCLIPV
window when the play '-->' button is pressed.  A value of 1 will update the
window afer each tool movement.  Increasing this value will cause the updates
to occur less frequently and the simulation to process faster.
